ðŸ“‹ VAPT Checklist (Docs and Workflow)
1. Environment Setup

 Ensure Kali Linux (attacker) and Metasploitable2 (target) are running in Bridge Adapter mode.

 Verify network connectivity (ping <target IP>).

 Update Kali tools (sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade).

2. Reconnaissance Phase

 Perform WHOIS lookup and document findings.

 Enumerate DNS records (A, MX, TXT).

 Run Sublist3r for subdomain discovery.

 Use Shodan/Maltego for exposed services.

 Perform Google dorking for sensitive files (robots.txt, admin portals).

 Log all recon activities in Reconnaissance/recon_logs.md.

 Save identified subdomains in Reconnaissance/osint_checks.md.

3. Vulnerability Scanning Phase

 Run Nmap service/version scan (nmap -A <target>).

 Save raw Nmap output in Vulnerability_Scanning/nmap_report.txt.

 Generate OpenVAS scan report and save as openvas_report.pdf.

 Run Nikto for web scanning and save results.

 Create vulnerability scan table (scan_tables.xlsx) with CVSS scores.

 Cross-check findings against CVE databases (Exploit-DB, NVD).

4. Exploitation Phase

 Select 2â€“3 high-priority vulnerabilities (Critical/High).

 Use Metasploit (e.g., tomcat_mgr_login) for exploitation.

 Run sqlmap on DVWA / target web app.

 Record all successful and failed exploits in Exploitation/exploit_results.txt.

 Validate exploits using Exploit-DB and write summaries in Exploitation/validation_summary.md.

5. Post-Exploitation Phase

 Attempt privilege escalation (e.g., bypassuac on Windows, kernel exploits on Linux).

 Dump hashes / credentials where possible.

 Collect artifacts (config files, logs) and record in Post-Exploitation/collected_evidence.md.

 Hash collected evidence with sha256sum and log in Post-Exploitation/privilege_escalation_logs.txt.

6. Reporting Phase

 Draft PTES Report (200+ words) in Docs_and_Workflow/PTES_report.pdf.

 Write a non-technical summary (100 words) in Docs_and_Workflow/summary.md.

 Draft developer escalation email in Docs_and_Workflow/summary.md (include PoC and CVE reference).

 Store all screenshots in Docs_and_Workflow/screenshots/.

7. Repository Management

 Add .gitignore file (ignore large outputs, secrets, swap files).

 Update README.md with project description, tools used, and workflow.

 Push all documents, logs, and reports to GitHub.

 Double-check folder structure before submission.

âœ… Final Note:
This checklist ensures every phase of the VAPT cycle is covered, from recon to reporting. Each task should leave behind a documented file in the correct repo folder for traceability.
