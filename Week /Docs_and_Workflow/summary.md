Capstone project executes a full VAPT cycle using Kali, Metasploit, OpenVAS and sqlmap. Begin with authorization, scope definition and environment snapshots. Perform reconnaissance and service enumeration, then run OpenVAS scans to identify vulnerabilities. Exploit confirmed issues (e.g., DVWA SQLi with sqlmap) and Metasploit modules to obtain access, documenting all commands, timestamps, and outputs. Collect evidence: logs, pcap, file hashes and screenshots. Validate findings against public PoCs and re-test. Prioritize risks, recommend mitigations, and prepare a clear report in Google Docs. Finally, remove artifacts, restore snapshots, and schedule remediation verification. Maintain strict confidentiality and encrypt archived evidence before external sharing now.
