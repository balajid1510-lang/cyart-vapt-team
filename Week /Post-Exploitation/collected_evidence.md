# Evidence Collection

During post-exploitation, critical configuration files were collected and hashed for integrity verification. SHA256 hashes were generated using the `sha256sum` tool on Kali Linux.

| Item        | Description      | Collected By  | Date       | Hash Value |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| Config File | target.conf      | VAPT Analyst  | 2025-08-18 | <SHA256> |

Procedure:
1. Identified important configuration file on the target system: target.conf
2. Downloaded the file to Kali using Meterpreter `download` command
3. Generated SHA256 hash:
    ```bash
    sha256sum target.conf
    ```
4. Logged hash value in `collected_evidence.md` to ensure integrity.
5. All evidence files and hash logs saved under `Post-Exploitation/evidence/`.

Notes:
- Ensure evidence is stored securely.
- Avoid modifying the original files on the target VM.
