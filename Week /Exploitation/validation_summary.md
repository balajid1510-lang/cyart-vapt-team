Successful exploitation of the Tomcat Manager interface on target 192.168.1.100 was achieved using Metasploitâ€™s exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_login. A Java Meterpreter reverse_tcp payload connected back to the attacker at 192.168.29.155, yielding an interactive session. Post-exploitation verification included sysinfo and getuid confirming the Meterpreter runtime and the tomcat service account, listing webapps to reveal an uploaded shell.war, and downloading the artifact to the attacker machine. Network-level evidence (tcpdump) and an established TCP connection on port 4444 corroborate the callback. SHA256 hashing of the downloaded shell.war provides file integrity proof. Logs and screenshots were archived locally.
